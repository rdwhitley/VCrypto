## FAQ ##
The App has a few shortcomings that I can see and wish to update in the early stages. Redux would be a better option to manage state as the app grows. Mobile Responsiveness should be given thought also. Also with the introduction of Redux I was thinking of having all diffrent currencies fetched at once then put in the store to avoid unneccsary AJAX calls and load times.

##To-Do ##
* Refactor code for optimal maintanence
* Implement Redux
* Implement styled components
